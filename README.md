This is the first HTML5 application I made on my own. I made it in around 3 hours as a class assignment. All programming was done by me. Sprites were also created by me, though that is not important.

Due to its simplicity, the game goes on forever (though I don't recommend actually playing it that long). The directions for the game appear under the HTML5 canvas on the webpage itself.

The game does not have an actual name.
